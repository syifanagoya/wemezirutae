His parents, John and Kay, were both American, and they were living in Germany while his father was stationed there for his job with the U.S. Air Force. When McEnroe was a baby, the family moved to Newburgh, New York's Stewart Air Force Base, and they relocated to Flushing, Queens, in 1961 and Douglaston in 1963. John's father later left the Air Force and worked as an advertising agent during the day and studied at Fordham Law School at night. John's brothers Mark and Patrick were born in 1964 and 1966, respectively, and Patrick also grew up to be professional tennis player. McEnroe began playing tennis at the age of 8, and the following year, he enrolled in the Eastern Lawn Tennis Association and was soon competing in regional tournaments. Ranked #7 in his age group at 12 years old, he joined the Port Washington Tennis Academy. John graduated from NYC's Trinity School in 1977.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>John joined the ATP tour in 1978 and finished the year as the #4 ranked player after winning 5 titles.

In 1980, McEnroe defeated <a href=# title="Björn Borg Net Worth">Björn Borg</a> at the US Open, two months after losing to him at the Wimbledon Men's Singles final. In 1981, he became known for shouting "you cannot be serious" at umpires, and the phrase became the title of his 2002 memoir. That year, he defeated Borg at Wimbledon and the US Open, and the Associated Press named him Athlete of the Year. John was 1984's #1 player, though he was not able to compete in London's Wembley Indoor tournament due to a 3-week suspension resulting from an angry outburst at a tournament in Stockholm. In 1986, McEnroe decided to take a 6-month break from competing, and he won 3 ATP tournaments after his return. However, the following year, he didn't win any titles and took another break after being suspended at the US Open.</p><p>In 1989, John won the World Championship Tennis Finals for the fifth time and was also victorious in the RCA Championships. He was ejected from the 1990 Australian Open for swearing at tournament officials and was eventually disqualified after a few more incidents.

In 1992, he won his fifth Wimbledon men's doubles title with the help of partner of Michael Stich and won the doubles rubber in the Davis Cup with <a href=# title="Pete Sampras Net Worth">Pete Sampras</a>.
