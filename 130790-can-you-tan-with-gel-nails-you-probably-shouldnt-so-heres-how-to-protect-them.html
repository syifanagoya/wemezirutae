You would be wrong. I know, I was surprised, too! But, it turns out,<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> tanning can totally mess up your gel manicure</a>, according to <i>Nails Magazine</i>. And in more ways than one. From sleuthing around nail care forums and chatting up my friends who tan (I, myself, don't tan in tanning beds.<i> Final Destination</i>, anyone?), I found out that tanning can cause your gel manicure to turn yellow, dry out, or lift. Plus, some tanning lotions cause yellowing and lifting, too. And it's not just gel nails. Acrylic nails can suffer the same fate.</p><p>One solution is to avoid tanning altogether. This is the solution that would make The <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>American Cancer Society</a> happy, considering tanning significantly increases your skin cancer risk. But if you're about that tanning life, and versed on the risks, you're probably more likely to skip your gels than skip your rays. But wait: You don't have to pick, because many brave nail and tanning lovers have gone before you and figured this whole mess out with science and good-old-fashioned ingenuity. Phew, right? Here's a breakdown of how to tan with gel nails without throwing your mani money in the toilet. Because, hello, nails aren't cheap and you don't drag your fabulously tanned and manicured self to work every single day for nothing. Anyway, here's what to do.</p><h3>1. Get Fancy</h3><p>Gel makers are getting hip to the fact that some types yellow under certain circumstances, so they've been on the ball <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>making gels that don't yellow</a>. They're on the pricier side, but they're becoming the standard at higher-end salons. If you're not already using these types of gels, as your tech to get them in. You'll probably have to pay more, but that's still cheaper than having to replace or repair a fried mani.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>CND Brisa Gloss Gel Top Coat</a>, $20, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Bodywork Mall</b></a></p><h3>2. Use A UV Topcoat</h3><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>UV topcoats</a> are like sunscreen for your mani. Actually, they <i>are</i> sunscreen for your mani. If you already have gel nails, and you're not sure if they are a brand that resist yellowing, a UV topcoat is like an insurance policy. You don't have to go back to the salon, because they go on like regular nail polish, and they're pretty cheap.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sally Hansen Ultimate Shield - Fortifying Base & Top Coat</a>, $5, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Target</a></b></p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Nars Top Coat</a>, $20, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Sephora</b></a></p><h3>3. Paint Your Nails</h3><p>A lot of people in the nail care forums said painting their nails before tanning was enough to protect them from damage. I can see how this might work, but I can see how it might also cause problems. For example, as a person who wears a gel overlay, and paints my nails on top of the gel regularly, I can say that the majority of my polishes stain my gel. If you need a quick solution that uses things you already have at home, I can see this as an option, but just know that if you plan on taking the polish off and going back to your gel mani, you might be destined for heartbreak. But you could always just keep painting them until it's time for new gels. Pros <i>and</i> cons, so...</p><h3>4. Get Nail Savers</h3><p>Nail savers are like these magical little mittens for your mani. Mani mittens! That's what they should be called. They're just little vinyl pockets that you slip over your nails to keep them safe from UV rays. You can reuse them forever, and they're inexpensive, so they might be the best solution. Plus you don't have to change anything about your nail care routine. Your tanning salon probably sells them, but if not, you can get some here:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Nail Savers Protective Nail Covers</a>, $11, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Tan For Less</b></a></p><h3>5. Use DHA-Free Tanning Lotion</h3><p>Some of the emulsifiers and other chemicals in tanning lotions, like dibutyl adipate and dihydroxyacetone, are also used in nail polish removers! That's why you might find that your nails are sticky or tacky after you use them. This <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>typically isn't the case for gels</a>, since they're pretty removal-resistant, unless you soak them for ages in acetone, but you might still find you have problems. They may even cause some lifting. It's hard to tell if a lotion will be hard on your nails without some testing, but DHA-free ones are a good place to start.</p><p>This should be all you need to know to keep your nail game strong while you work on your tanning game.</p><p><i>Images: </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Pixabay</i></a><i>; </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Giphy</i></a><i> (5)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyf49wcGllk5a7bsXOrmStmZ5ixKrAx2aenqRdo66quNJmsKitXaW%2FsK7Am6OyZaOdvLa4w6erZqufYrWmvsSsZKGnp2LBsHnPq6atnZOperW0xKY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f130790-can-you-tan-with-gel-nails-you-probably-shouldnt-so-heres-how-to-protect-them.html&text=Can%20You%20Tan%20With%20Gel%20Nails%3f%20You%20Probably%20Shouldn%27t%2c%20So%20Here%27s%20How%20To%20Protect%20Them&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f130790-can-you-tan-with-gel-nails-you-probably-shouldnt-so-heres-how-to-protect-them.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f130790-can-you-tan-with-gel-nails-you-probably-shouldnt-so-heres-how-to-protect-them.html&title=Can%20You%20Tan%20With%20Gel%20Nails%3f%20You%20Probably%20Shouldn%27t%2c%20So%20Here%27s%20How%20To%20Protect%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f130790-can-you-tan-with-gel-nails-you-probably-shouldnt-so-heres-how-to-protect-them.html&title=Can%20You%20Tan%20With%20Gel%20Nails%3f%20You%20Probably%20Shouldn%27t%2c%20So%20Here%27s%20How%20To%20Protect%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f130790-can-you-tan-with-gel-nails-you-probably-shouldnt-so-heres-how-to-protect-them.html&title=Can%20You%20Tan%20With%20Gel%20Nails%3f%20You%20Probably%20Shouldn%27t%2c%20So%20Here%27s%20How%20To%20Protect%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f130790-can-you-tan-with-gel-nails-you-probably-shouldnt-so-heres-how-to-protect-them.html&description=Can%20You%20Tan%20With%20Gel%20Nails%3f%20You%20Probably%20Shouldn%27t%2c%20So%20Here%27s%20How%20To%20Protect%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./melissa-lee-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melissa Lee Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./monica-corgan-instagram-star-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-measurements-boyfriend-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monica Corgan (Instagram Star) Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Measurements, Boyfriend, Net Wo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
