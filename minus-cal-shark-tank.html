These two individuals bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the <b>weight loss supplement</b> industry.</p><p>Crom Carmichael began his career as a columnist, captivating readers with his insightful perspectives on various topics. He later transitioned into the realm of business and politics, where he showcased his expertise as a commentator. As an <b>angel investor</b>, Crom has a keen eye for spotting emerging trends and promising ventures.</p><p>Barrett Jacques, on the other hand, embarked on a different path. He entered the <b>music industry</b> as a recording artist and talented <b>songwriter</b>, collaborating with renowned artists at <b>Sony Music Entertainment</b>. Barrett’s creative flair and passion for innovation make him the perfect partner in developing groundbreaking products.</p><p>“We knew that combining our unique skill sets and experiences would enable us to create something truly special in the weight loss industry.” – Crom Carmichael</p><p>“Music and entrepreneurship have always been my passions. Through Minus Cal, I get to explore both worlds and help people achieve their health goals.” – Barrett Jacques</p><p>Crom and Barrett’s diverse backgrounds and unwavering determination set the foundation for Minus Cal’s journey towards revolutionizing the weight loss market.</p><h2>Founding Minus Cal</h2><p>In 2017, Barrett Jacques had a vision to create a <b>healthy protein bar</b> that could aid in weight loss. As he was exploring various ingredients, he stumbled upon <b>Choleve extract</b> derived from <b>green tea</b>, known for its potential to block <b>fat absorption</b> in the <b>small intestine</b>. Intrigued by the idea, Barrett enlisted the help of Crom Carmichael, and together they formulated the Minus Cal bars using <b>Choleve extract</b>. With their innovative product in hand, they embarked on their entrepreneurial journey.</p><h3>The Science Behind Minus Cal Bars</h3><p><b>Green tea</b> has long been associated with health benefits, and <b>Choleve extract</b> takes it a step further in the quest for weight loss. The extract contains compounds that have been found to interfere with <b>fat absorption</b> in the <b>small intestine</b>, potentially aiding in weight management. By preventing the <b>small intestine</b> from absorbing fats, Minus Cal bars aimed to provide a natural solution for individuals looking to shed pounds.</p><p>“Our goal was to create a protein bar that not only satisfies hunger but also supports weight loss. With Choleve extract as a key ingredient, we believe our bars can positively impact <b>fat absorption</b> in the body,” said Barrett Jacques, co-founder of Minus Cal.</p><p>With this unique selling proposition, Minus Cal entered the market as a promising weight loss solution for health-conscious individuals.</p><p>The founders’ belief in the effectiveness of Choleve extract, combined with their passion for providing a <b>healthy protein bar</b> option, fueled their motivation to bring Minus Cal to fruition. They were determined to offer a product that not only tasted great but also had the potential to make a difference in people’s lives.</p><p>However, developing a new product and establishing a brand in a <b>competitive market</b> is no easy task. The founders faced numerous challenges, from sourcing high-quality ingredients to perfecting the taste of the bars. Through perseverance and dedication, they overcame these hurdles and were ready to introduce Minus Cal bars to the world.</p><h3>Bringing Minus Cal Bars to the Market</h3><p>In 2017, Minus Cal officially launched its healthy <b>protein bars</b>. The bars featured a unique combination of Choleve extract and other wholesome ingredients, making them a convenient snack option for individuals on a weight loss journey. With their bold claims of fat absorption prevention, Minus Cal bars aimed to differentiate themselves in the crowded protein bar market.</p><p>The founders leveraged the growing interest in <b>natural weight loss</b> solutions and positioned Minus Cal bars as an alternative to traditional diet pills and appetite suppressants. They believed that by offering a healthy and tasty protein bar, they could attract a wide range of consumers looking for a more sustainable and enjoyable approach to weight loss.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Minus-Cal-Bars-1024x585.jpg alt="Minus Cal Bars" title="Minus Cal Bars" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><table><tr><th>Key Features of Minus Cal Bars</th><th>Benefits</th></tr><tr><td><b>Healthy protein bar</b></td><td>A convenient snack option packed with essential nutrients</td></tr><tr><td>Choleve extract</td><td>Potential contribution to blocking fat absorption in the small intestine</td></tr><tr><td>Wholesome ingredients</td><td>Nutritious components to support overall well-being</td></tr><tr><td>Tasty flavors</td><td>An enjoyable snack to satisfy cravings</td></tr></table><p>The founders were committed to transparency and ensured that the ingredients used in their bars were of the highest quality. By prioritizing the taste, texture, and nutritional value of the bars, they aimed to create a product that would resonate with health-conscious consumers.</p><p>With Minus Cal bars officially on the market, the founders were hopeful that their innovative approach to weight loss would captivate consumers and carve a niche in the industry. They eagerly awaited feedback and the opportunity to make a positive impact on people’s health and well-being.</p><h2>Shark Tank Pitch</h2><p>In Season 11 of Shark Tank, Crom and Barrett presented their innovative weight loss supplement, Minus Cal, in a bid to secure a significant investment. They sought <b>$500</b>,000 in exchange for a <b>20% equity stake</b> in their company.</p><p>Crom and Barrett passionately pitched the product to the Sharks, highlighting its unique fat-blocking capabilities. They backed up their claims with scientific research, emphasizing the potential benefits for individuals seeking natural weight loss solutions.</p><p>“Minus Cal is not just another <b>fat-burning pill</b>. Our <b>protein bars</b>, infused with Choleve extract derived from <b>green tea</b>, can help consumers achieve their weight loss goals by blocking fat absorption in the small intestine.”</p><p>The founders hoped that their appearance on Shark Tank would propel their product to the next level and provide the capital needed for expansion.</p><h3>Sharks’ Skepticism and Critical Feedback</h3><p>However, the Sharks expressed skepticism regarding Minus Cal’s taste, valuation, and lack of substantial sales. They raised concerns about the competitive nature of the weight loss supplement market and the limited evidence supporting the product’s efficacy.</p><p>Despite the founders’ passionate pitch and scientific evidence, the Sharks ultimately decided not to invest in Minus Cal. The critical feedback served as a reality check for Crom and Barrett, highlighting the need for further development and market validation.</p><table><tr><th>Shark</th><th>Reason for Not Investing</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Mark Cuban</td><td>Valuation was too high for a product with minimal sales and unproven market demand.</td></tr><tr><td>Barbara Corcoran</td><td>Concerned about the taste of the <b>protein bars</b> and the product’s ability to appeal to a broader consumer base.</td></tr><tr><td>Daymond John</td><td>Questioned the long-term viability and scalability of Minus Cal in the highly competitive weight loss industry.</td></tr><tr><td>Kevin O’Leary</td><td>Not convinced by the founders’ financial projections and saw limited potential for a substantial return on investment.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Although no deal was secured, Crom and Barrett remained determined to refine their product and overcome the challenges highlighted by the Sharks.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shark-Tank-Season-11-Pitch-1024x585.jpg alt="Shark Tank Season 11 Pitch" title="Shark Tank Season 11 Pitch" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite their unsuccessful pitch, Crom and Barrett saw the experience as a valuable learning opportunity and an opportunity to refine their product for future success.</p><h2>The Downfall of Minus Cal</h2><p>After their appearance on Shark Tank, Minus Cal found it challenging to survive in the competitive weight loss market. The product garnered <b>negative reviews</b> from customers, averaging only 1.9 stars on Amazon. Furthermore, the company encountered financial difficulties due to <b>low sales</b> and a limited advertising budget. As a result, Minus Cal’s <b>social media presence</b> became inactive in 2019, and they eventually had to shut down their online store. The absence of scientific research and the erosion of customer trust ultimately led to the demise of the business, which ceased operations in 2020.</p><table><tr><th>Challenges Faced by Minus Cal</th><th>Consequences</th></tr><tr><td>Highly <b>competitive market</b></td><td>Struggled to gain market share against established brands</td></tr><tr><td>Negative customer reviews</td><td>Averaged 1.9 stars on Amazon, impacting reputation and customer trust</td></tr><tr><td><b>Low sales</b></td><td>Financial challenges and inability to generate sufficient revenue</td></tr><tr><td><b>Lack of advertising</b> budget</td><td>Unable to create brand awareness and reach target audience effectively</td></tr><tr><td>Inactive <b>social media presence</b></td><td>Limited engagement and loss of customer connection</td></tr><tr><td>Closure of online store</td><td>Shut down operations due to financial constraints</td></tr></table><p>Minus Cal’s downfall serves as a cautionary tale in the weight loss industry.
