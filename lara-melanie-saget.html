It is quite hard to extract information about her salary, income, and wealth. She is in her thirties, and by this age, Melanie has a high possibility of earning independently.</p><p>Moreover, the star has been living lavishly since childhood on her father's fortune. Her father, Bob, makes a huge amount of money from his career as a comedian, actor, and television host.

One of his most noted appearances includes as a widowed father on the <i>Full House</i>. The show was hyped that it reached the top 20 after a short time after its premiere on <i>ABC</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/7/18/Lara%20Melanie%20Saget%20career-1563446005258.jpg><p>The star, in addition, is also involved in charity work.
