Brown/Getty Images</p><h2 id=hulu-adult-swim-deals><strong>Hulu and Adult Swim Deals</strong></h2><p>At the height of his success, Justin signed large overall deals with both Hulu and Adult Swim. Between the two deals, before his arrest Justin was likely earning at least $5 million per year and ultimately could have earned $50 â€“ 100 million depending on the success of shows he eventually created.
