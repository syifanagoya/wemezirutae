Roiland voiced the show's characters in various video games, as well.</p><p>Roiland had myriad other voice-acting roles during his time on "Rick and Morty."

Brown/Getty Images</p><h2 id=hulu-adult-swim-deals><strong>Hulu and Adult Swim Deals</strong></h2><p>At the height of his success, Justin signed large overall deals with both Hulu and Adult Swim. Between the two deals, before his arrest Justin was likely earning at least $5 million per year and ultimately could have earned $50 – 100 million depending on the success of shows he eventually created. In January 2023 both networks severed ties with Roiland and reportedly voided their contracts.</p><h2 id=podcasts><strong>Podcasts</strong></h2><p>Beyond visual media, Roiland has been involved with some podcasts. From 2010 to 2016, he co-hosted "Grandma's Virginity Podcast" with Ryan Ridley and Jackie Buscarino.
