While Paige is known for her fashion advice, the most sought after segment on her Instagram page is her ‘Looks for Less’ posts. The segment focuses on getting celebrity looks on a budget.</p><p>“We lived in Albany so I wasn’t running to Bergdorfs or something, so we would go to Forever 21 or Marshalls and find something that looked similar.
