She revealed that she was married to a husband during a <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPEmpHrnErY" rel=noopener>Q&A video</a> on YouTube on September 10, 2018.</p><p>Her revelation was also shocking, as she disclosed that she got married at the age of 19. Born on November 14, 1994, the internet personality is presently 27 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Moriah Elizabeth’s husband?</h2><p>While Elizabeth revealed she had a husband in her 2018 video, she eventually revealed that her husband’s name was Jordan in another Q&A video in April 2019.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>And before she revealed his full details and that they were married, Jordan used to appear in her videos occasionally and was introduced to her viewers as her friend.</p><p>“His name is Jordan. He has been on the camera in the past. I’ll show you a couple of clips of him and me when we were teenagers. He looks a little different now, remarkably, I don’t. I’m not aging but it’s kind of scaring me,” she said in her 2019 video.</p><p>In addition, she was asked about when she will make a full-fledged video with her husband, to which she replied, “Probably, on his own time, though.”</p><p>The couple apparently tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony around 2013. That makes them married to each other for over 8 years as of 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moriah Elizabeth’s husband Jordan featured in her early YouTube videos</h2><p>Elizabeth’s husband Jordan has featured in a number of her early YouTube videos.</p><p>In one of her very early videos titled ‘Worst Things to Say to a Girl,’ Jordan appeared in it. Posted in July 2012, the video’s description stated that they had to practice for about a half hour before filming because Jordan was very camera shy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Similarly, he was also featured in March 2013 and July 2013 videos titled ‘How to Get a Guy to Like You’ and ‘11 Ways to Break Up,’ respectively.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moriah Elizabeth and husband Jordan have a baby together</h2><p>Just like her marriage detail, Elizabeth also shocked her fans with the news of her baby. The YouTube star, in her July 2022 video, shared that she and her husband were blessed with a baby girl.</p><p>She shared that she is a mother — and she had hidden the details, from her pregnancy to her baby name, for a long time. But in the video, she disclosed that her daughter was 10 months old in July 2022.</p><p>“I have a child,” she revealed. “I have one daughter, it is just one secret child. Nothing crazy”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>She added, “The last video I filmed while pregnancy was a dollar store makeover. I was eight months pregnant when I filmed this video. I raised my table up pretty high so that you couldn’t see my pregnancy.”</p><p>Going by that detail, it is apparent that her baby was born around October 2021.</p><p>Later in the video, she explained her reasons for not sharing the details earlier.</p><p>She said, “I kept putting it off because I was nervous about how you guys would feel about the fact that I didn’t share sooner. I didn’t want you to feel like I was trying to trick you. I hope you guys aren’t mad at me. Hope you guys understand why I waited so long to tell you.”</p><p>Elizabeth then added that she was not sure if she would ever reveal her baby’s name or post a video with her, as she wanted to respect her baby’s privacy. That being said, she ended up showing her daughter to her viewers in the video.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Late Actor Lance Reddick Had Great Relationship with His Wife and Two Kids</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Lance Reddick’s wife, Stephanie Reddick, is deeply saddened by his demise.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lance-Reddick-Wife.jpg alt="Late Actor Lance Reddick Had Great Relationship with His Wife and Two Kids" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Late actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lance Reddick</a> and his wife, Stephanie Reddick, shared a strong and enduring relationship, built on love and trust, spanning over two decades.</p><p>Lance met his wife in 1999 while he was working on a play at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, whereas Stephanie was an employee there. The two quickly became close and developed a romantic connection, leading to a decade-long relationship.</p><p>Later, the couple eventually tied the knot in 2011 in a low-key ceremony at Bar Lurcat in Minneapolis, Stephanie’s home state. They also deliberately chose a single venue for both the ceremony and reception to simplify things for out-of-town guests.</p><p>During the wedding, the actor set only two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rules</a> for the celebration. The first rule was that everyone had to have fun, and the second was that Lance couldn’t see his wife’s wedding dress before she walked down the aisle.</p><p>Similarly, Stephanie embraced simplicity in her wedding preparations, allocating a modest $250 for her dress, which the actor personally picked up from the post office. She also chose floral arrangements for the dress details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lance-Reddick-Wife.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lance Reddick and his wife, Stephanie Reddick, were together for over two decades. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spamchronicles</a>)</p><p>Recalling her relaxed attitude, she shared, “I told the florist I didn’t care about the flower type, as long as they were pretty. She suggested peonies because they were in season. I didn’t even know the flower color until the wedding day, and they turned out beautifully.”</p><p>Additionally, she fondly recalled her favorite moment as the day her mom saw her in the dress and moved to tears.</p><p>Although the couple openly shared details about their love story and wedding, they intentionally chose to keep the rest of their married life more private, valuing a sense of intimacy and personal space.</p><p>However, the actor and his wife made several red-carpet appearances together over the years, attending events such as premieres for movies like White House Down, The Blacklist, and Godzilla vs Kong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>https://t.co/udSaRa6iKL</a> Lance Reddick's wife Stephanie Reddick pays tribute to late actor <a href=#>https://t.co/eqbLpMmEA0</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/crANvc7Nzv</a></p>— Film-News.co.uk (@FilmNewsWeb) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 19, 2023</a></figure><p>Now, following Lance’s untimely passing due to heart disease, his wife took a moment to connect with her late husband’s fans and express profound gratitude.

Thank you for all your overwhelming love, support, and beautiful stories shared on these platforms over the last day. I see your messages and can’t begin to express how grateful I am to have them.”</p><p>In addition to this heartfelt message, she extended special thanks to the thousands of Destiny players who participated in a tribute to Lance, emphasizing, “And to the thousands of Destiny players who played in a special tribute to Lance, thank you. Lance loved you as much as he loved the game.”</p><p>Upon seeing the post, an outpouring of condolences and tributes flooded in from the actor’s friends and fans. <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/celebrity/faizon-love-health-weight-loss/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Halle Berry</a>, a fellow star, shared a poignant comment, “My love and prayers are with the family at this unfortunate time. Lance was one of the most sincere people I’d ever met. Truly one of a kind! RIP sweet king.”</p><p>Likewise, Ana Gasteyer shared her condolences, stating, “Sending so much love and sympathy. He was an extraordinary talent and had an amazing career. And he loved his wife and family so much. A life, far too short, but so well lived.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lance Reddick has two children, but not with his wife Stephanie Reddick</h2><p>Lance and his wife, Stephanie, didn’t have children together, although Stephanie likely played a key role in raising Lance’s two kids. The late actor had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">children</a> with his first wife, Suzanne Yvonne Louis — a daughter named Yvonne Nicole and a son named Christopher Reddick.</p><p>As of now, both of his children have grown up. But as Lance deliberately kept them out of the spotlight throughout his life, he didn’t share many pictures of his kids on social media, and neither talked about being a father in any of his interviews.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside the marital life of Lance Reddick and his first wife Suzanne Yvonne Louis</h2><p>Lance <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">married</a> his first wife, jewelry designer Suzanne, in 1986.

Post-separation, Suzanne became a mother to Kaiya Dane Meier, her child with Karl Meier.</p><p>Unfortunately, the actor’s first wife faced a tragic turn of events, suffering a heart attack and falling into a coma from which she never recovered. Later, on November 3, 2011, she passed away, marking a deeply sorrowful chapter in their lives.</p><p>After Suzanne’s passing, Lance candidly discussed the profound loss of his first wife and the mother of his two children in an interview with Strombo in 2012.</p><p>Reflecting on the impact of the tragedy, the actor emphasized, “It made me realize that I always have to keep in front of me why I’m doing this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/couple.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lance Reddick with one of his two children (Photo: Facebook)</p><p>Sharing the emotional weight of becoming his kids’ sole parent, he stated, “I felt it more with my ex-wife because suddenly I was my kids’ only parent… I have great kids, and it’s because they had a great mom.”</p><p>After his first wife’s passing, Lance and his second wife, Stephanie, continued to care for and raise his children, providing them with love and support.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Melissa Fumero Had Crush on Husband David Fumero Long before Wedding — Their Married Life</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Melissa Fumero and David Fumero have been together for more than a decade.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Melissa-Fumero-Wedding.jpg alt="Melissa Fumero Had Crush on Husband David Fumero Long before Wedding — Their Married Life" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>American actress Melissa Fumero had a crush on her now-husband, David Fumero, ever since her teenage years, and little did she know at the time that one day, he would become her spouse.</p><p>When Melissa had a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crush</a> on David, he was a young model who even made a brief cameo in Mariah Carey’s 1997 hit single ‘Honey.’ However, when the actress finally met David on the set of One Life to Live, she didn’t recognize him.</p><p>At that time, Melissa played the role of Adriana Cramer, while her now-beau appeared as Cristian Vega on the show. As the duo kept spending time together on the show, they formed a close bond and began dating, but she didn’t realize he was her childhood crush.</p><p>The surprise came later during a date when the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/brooklyn-nine-nine/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a> star’s husband mentioned the ‘Honey’ video.

Leading up to the special day, the actor had shared insights into the preparations, expressing a mix of stress and excitement.</p><p>He remarked, “So far, it’s been nothing but stress and joy.

According to a source, Samberg’s speech achieved the perfect balance between humor and sentiment, leading to tears from both him and his wife.</p><p>Moreover, the evening before the wedding, the joyful couple was also celebrated at a lively rehearsal dinner, where many of the comedically gifted guests entertained with stand-up performances.</p><p>After tying the knot, the actor humorously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quipped</a> to People stating, “I liked it and I put a ring on it.” He also shared details about their enchanting honeymoon in the Maldives, describing it as an incredible experience.</p><p>Similarly, Newsom later affectionately expressed that her husband is her “favorite person in the world,” praising him as the biggest superfan of her music. She continued, saying, “He’s the person I would most want to hang out with at any given moment.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Andy Samberg and Joanna Newsom first met through mutual friends</h2><p>Samberg and Newsom’s love story began in 2008 when they were introduced through mutual friends. The connection was instant, but what added a charming layer to their romance was the actor’s pre-meeting admiration for his future wife’s musical talents.</p><p>On the other hand, Newsom was also captivated by her husband’s acting talent. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confessed</a> to being a fan of his work, particularly recalling the night they first met at one of her shows. Fred Armisen, a mutual acquaintance, brought Samberg along, and Newsom couldn’t help but appreciate his comedic talent.</p><p>She fondly remembered the actor’s cameo in The Lonely Island’s sketch video ‘Just 2 Guyz,’ where he played the character Steve the c**t. When they met, Newsom greeted him with a playful reference to his on-screen persona.</p><p>Just a few days after their initial meeting, the two embarked on a romantic journey together.

He stated, “With a baby, it’s all about just sitting down and watching TV with my wife at the end of the day; Wild Wild Country or something.”</p><p>“That way, we can focus on everyone else’s problems. We try to find the humor in everything,” he added. Similarly, during the COVID-19 lockdown, Samberg and Newsom, like many others, took a break from their work engagements.</p><p>This pause allowed them to cherish family life and witness their daughter following in her mother’s footsteps.
