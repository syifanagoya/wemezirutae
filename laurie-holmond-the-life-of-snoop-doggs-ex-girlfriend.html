She was born and reared in California, United States of America. However, most of her early information, including her parents, remain hidden.</p><p>Snoop, her ex-boyfriend, was born on October 20, 1971, in Long Beach, California, and will be 51 years old in 2022. In terms of his parents, he is the son of Vernell Varnado and Beverly Tate.</p><h2><span id=Laurie_Holmond_Education>Laurie Holmond Education</span></h2><p>In terms of schooling, Laurie attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School in California. Holmond met her future boyfriend there as well. Dogg continued his education at Compton College after graduating.</p><h2><span id=Holmond8217s_Nationality_And_Ethnicity>Holmond’s Nationality And Ethnicity</span></h2><p>Laurie Holmond ethnicity is described as African-American. Similarly, the former celebrity girlfriend is an American citizen.</p><p>Snoop Dogg, like her, is of African-American origin and holds American citizenship. In addition, in 2009, the artist converted to Islam. Similarly, after visiting Jamaica in 2012, Dogg converted to the Rastafari Movement.</p><h2><span id=What_is_Laurie_Holmond8217s_occupation>What is Laurie Holmond’s occupation?</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Laurie Holmond is a private woman who hasn’t revealed much about her personal life in the media. Similarly, Laurie has kept her professional life private. As a result, information on her present career efforts is still scarce.</p><p>On the other hand, we’re all familiar with her ex-partner Snoop’s profession. To date, the rapper has had a handful of hits. Laurie received numerous medals and honors for his musical abilities during his career. Among his many honors are the American Music Award and the Primetime Emmy Award. He has also been nominated for a number of Grammy Awards.</p><p>In 1991, Holmond’s ex-lover released his debut album, Over The Counter. Some of his fans’ favorite tracks from the album are Dope Slang, Knockin’ Off Everything, Let Em’ Understand, and True To The Game.</p><p>Since then, the best rappers of all time have released numerous albums, topping numerous musical charts.</p><h2><span id=Snoop_Dogg8217s_Ex-Boyfriend_Laurie_Holmond8217s_Relationship>Snoop Dogg’s Ex-Boyfriend Laurie Holmond’s Relationship</span></h2><p>The former couple first met in high school in Long Beach, California, where they both attended. In fact, Laurie and her future romantic partner Snoop met as friends first. But their friendship eventually developed into affection, and they began dating.</p><p>The exes were so close, according to Holmond, until Snoop’s marriage to his current wife Shante. Laurie also stated that she was unaware of Snoop’s secret romance with Shante, with whom he has three children, Cordell Broadus, Corde Broadus, and Cori Broadus. When she found out about it, she said,</p><p>We had a wonderful connection until June of 1997, when I heard on the radio that he had married. Calvin warned me that I wouldn’t understand, and he was correct; I didn’t want anything to do with him.</p><p>Laurie and Snoop reunited again and hooked up in the La Reve Hotel in Hollywood, California, three months after Snoop’s marriage to his current wife Shante. It was when the artist impregnated Holmond.</p><h2><span id=When_Holmond_was_pregnant_Snoop_Dogg_was_terrified_of_his_wife_Shante>When Holmond was pregnant, Snoop Dogg was terrified of his wife Shante.</span></h2><p>In the same interview, Snoop Dogg’s former partner Holmond said that the rapper was frightened of his wife’s pregnancy. She stated,</p><p>“When I told Calvin I was pregnant, he said,’I don’t know how I’m going to tell Shante.”</p><p>Whatever the case may be, Laurie’s beau was present when she gave birth to their first child, Julian Corrie Broadus, on June 18, 1998. “When Julian was born,” she added, “Calvin was right there, and he took responsibility like a man.”</p><p>However, Laurie stated that the rap legend has not communicated with their kid since early 2003. She subsequently filed a paternity suit in court, and the rapper was found to be the father of her child.</p><h2><span id=Julian_her_son_was_noticeably_absent_from_Snoop_Dogg8217s_Father_Hood_reality_show>Julian, her son, was noticeably absent from Snoop Dogg’s Father Hood reality show.</span></h2><p>Snoop Dogg’s Father Hood, a reality TV show, premiered in December 2007. It follows Dogg and his family, which includes his wife Shante and their three children, on a daily basis.</p><p>However, when the show debuted on E! in the United States on December 9, 2007, one of his kids, Julian, was not among the cast members. Julian told Star magazine about Snoop’s lack of involvement in his life:</p><p>“I should be with him on the show, but I’m not,” he explained, “because I don’t want to be an actor; I want to be a basketball player.” But I want to be on the show so that I may get to know my family better. It would be fantastic if we could all simply hang out together. I’m hoping we’ll be able to do that one day.”</p><p>However, in the years that followed, the father and son looked extremely similar. Julian started his career in real estate.</p><h2><span id=In_2022_is_Laurie_Holmond_dating_anyone>In 2022, is Laurie Holmond dating anyone?</span></h2><p>Concerning her present relationship status with Dogg’s ex Laurie, she has been tight-lipped about her love life after her divorce from the rapper. She isn’t on any social media platforms and hasn’t made any recent public appearances.</p><p>As a result, determining if Laurie has gone on with anyone is difficult. According to some publications, she is now single.</p><p>Her old partner, on the other hand, is still married to Shante.</p><h2><span id=Laurie_Holmond_Net_Worth>Laurie Holmond Net Worth</span></h2><p>In terms of net worth, Laurie is projected to be worth $1 million. Snoop Dogg, on the other hand, has a gigantic net worth of $150 million. He made the most of his money from his music profession.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Ex-Girlfriend</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>All About Charlie Tahan I Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Luba Farmiga | Know About Vera Farmiga’s Mother</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfoa62vsieZKGnnKK8r7CMrZ%2BeZZyes6Z5zp9krKafpL1usM6gnqxlla16qLXRpZ2roZWjsXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flaurie-holmond-the-life-of-snoop-doggs-ex-girlfriend.html&text=Laurie%20Holmond%20%7c%20The%20Life%20of%20Snoop%20Doggs%20Ex-Girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flaurie-holmond-the-life-of-snoop-doggs-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flaurie-holmond-the-life-of-snoop-doggs-ex-girlfriend.html&title=Laurie%20Holmond%20%7c%20The%20Life%20of%20Snoop%20Doggs%20Ex-Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flaurie-holmond-the-life-of-snoop-doggs-ex-girlfriend.html&title=Laurie%20Holmond%20%7c%20The%20Life%20of%20Snoop%20Doggs%20Ex-Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flaurie-holmond-the-life-of-snoop-doggs-ex-girlfriend.html&title=Laurie%20Holmond%20%7c%20The%20Life%20of%20Snoop%20Doggs%20Ex-Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flaurie-holmond-the-life-of-snoop-doggs-ex-girlfriend.html&description=Laurie%20Holmond%20%7c%20The%20Life%20of%20Snoop%20Doggs%20Ex-Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./moriah-elizabeth-husband-baby.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Moriah Elizabeth and Husband Jordan Welcomed Their Baby Girl Secretly">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heres-what-kody-brown-from-sister-wives-really-does-for-a-living.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's What Kody Brown From Sister Wives Really Does For A Living">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
